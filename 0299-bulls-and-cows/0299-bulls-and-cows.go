    1. maintain a freq map of secret string
    2. find out all the bulls
        - i.e count guess chars that are in the correct position as secret chars
        - loop over guess string, and check if guess[i] == secret[i]
        - if it does, increment bulls counter and reduce the freq of this char from freqMap since we can no longer use it
    3. find out all the cows
        - i.e count all the chars from guess that exist in secret
        - HOWEVER we should avoid double counting if char at ith idx is same (guess[i] == secret[i])
            - because our step #2 did this already, so they should not be checked again
        - if guess[i] char exists in freqMap and its count > 0
            - cows++
            - reduce freq of char in freqMap
    time = o(n) + o(n) + o(n) = o(n)
