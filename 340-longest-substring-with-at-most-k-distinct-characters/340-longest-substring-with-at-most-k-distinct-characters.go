        longest substr == sliding window
        
        window type:
        - Dynamic, since we are looking for the longest window possible
        
        So we need to find longest substr with at most k distinct chars -- i.e a substr with no more than k uniq chars
        
        So how do we keep track of number of characters seen so far?
        - map, a charFreq map
        
        What keeps increasing the window size?
        - as long as len(map) <= k
        
        When do we shrink our window?
        - if the len of our map > k
        - we will slide the window from left side and remove that left char freq count from our map
        - but that does not gurantee that our map will be <= k
        - we could have left ptr pointing to "a" and then another "a" after sliding -- still the map size wont be less than k
        - so then a while loop while len(map) > k 
        
        time: o(n)
        space: o(n)

    // we could use a ascii value too instead -- that works for char by char
    // wont work for words ( sum of all ascii values of all chars in words ) because collision - so prime product it instead...
