    approach: store a pair(val, distAway) in a maxHeap
    - For each n elements
    - Calc the distance : arr[n] - x
    - Create a pair {val, distAway}
    - Store in maxHeap ( maxHeap sorted by distAway so the farthest pair will be on the top )
    - If the maxHeap size > k heap.pop()
    - Once all the elements are done,
    - The maxHeap will be left with k pairs that are the closest to x
    - Loop over maxHeap items and store them in result array and return
    
    time: o(n) * o(logk) = o(nlogk)
    - why k? because in maxHeap we will only store k elements
    - where did the n come from? We loop over all elements to store them in maxHeap therefore o(n) * o(logk)
    space: o(k) - in maxHeap at worse, we will store k elements
    However I still had to sort the final result -- Did I do something wrong?  (+ o(klogk) to time for sorting the final k size output list)
    
    
    approach: 2 pointers
    - left ptr at 0
    - right ptr at n-1
    - while the distance between left and right != k
        - i.e until we do not have a window of size k
        - get leftDist to x
        - get rightDist to x
        - whoever is farther from x, move away from that value 
            - if rightDist is farther from x compared to leftDist, then right--
            - else left++
        - If the distance is the same, then move away from bigger value
    - once we have a valid window of size k
    - then loop from left to right and populate the result arr
    - time: o(n-k)+o(k)
    - space: o(1)
    
    
    approach: Binary search to look for the starting point of the range
    - left = 0
    - right = len(arr)-k
        - Why not last idx?
        - BECAUSE we are doing binary search to look for THE STARTING IDX OF THE RANGE OF ELEMENTS
        - THE LAST VALID STARTING IDX WITHIN ARR WOULD BE len(arr)-k right... therefore ( do not forget we are doing binary search to find a VALID starting point)
    - Then we get the mid
    - When we are doing binary search we always use mid to see if thats our target right?
    - but since we are looking for a starting point from within our range, we will use mid to see IF mid is a potential starting point...
    - but how do we check that?
    - if mid == start point then that means mid+k-1 would be the k size range right?
    - so if mid is truly the starting point, then distance from mid to x must be smaller than of distance from endPoint to x
        - endPoint here is mid+k ( i.e the last element in this range )
    - how do we get the distance from mid to x? -> x-arr[mid]
    - how do we get the distance from endPoint to x -> arr[mid+k]-x
    - In our two pointers, whichever distance was closer, we moved towards that, ( or whichever distance was farthest from x we moved away from that )
    - Same principle applies here, if startDist > endDist - move away from startPtr ( left ptr ) 
    - Otherwise move away from endDist (right ptr )
    - What about when startDist == endDist?
        - In two pointers and the question itself states, that if two distances are equal use the smaller value
        - Then in our binary search we will do the same
        - But how? and what would that look like...
        - If startDist/leftDist == endDist/rightDist then we obv do not want to lean towards endDist/rightDist -- so right = mid ( move away from current right ptr )
    - Once our binary search breaks out of the loop, then we can use the left ptr to pull out arr[left:left+k-1] elements (k closest elements)
    
    Time: o(logn-k) to search + o(k) for the final list generation
    Space: o(1)
