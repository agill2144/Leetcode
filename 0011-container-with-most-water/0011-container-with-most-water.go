/*
    approach: 2 pointers ( one on each side )
    - we are basically looking for a container that has the max widht given height and width
    - with 2 pointers, we will have to pick and choose from 2 heights
        - do we pick the left or right height 
        - well, container will only hold water until the smallest height, it will start flowing over if water exceeds the smaller height
        - therefore between the 2 heights ( left and right ) -- we will pick the smaller one.
    - To get the widht - this is just windowSize but not the +1 at the end ( right - left )
    - Then save the max area as needed
    - finally return the max
    
    time: o(n)
    space: o(1)
