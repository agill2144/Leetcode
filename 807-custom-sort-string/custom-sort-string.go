/*
    we want to sort s based on a custom "order"
    therefore we should collect all chars from order string that also exist in "s"
    because order matters, chars in $order must be placed first
    
    appraoch: using a freq map
    - store chars of s in a freq map
    - loop thru the order string to collect chars that should be placed first
    - if the order[i] does exist in s map, take it and add it to our output
        - freq val times
        - delete this key from s map
    - then loop over s string one last time, to collect remaining chars that did not exist in $order
    - there is a possibility that not all chars of $s exist in $order,
    - therefore we must also preserve the order of chars in $s that do not exist in $order
    
    s = len(s)
    t = len(order)
    
    time = o(s) + o(t) + o(s)
    space = o(s)
