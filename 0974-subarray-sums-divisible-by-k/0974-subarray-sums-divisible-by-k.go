/*
    subarray sum whose is divisible by k ( i.e $sum % k == 0 )
    we can check from start(0th idx) -> ith element by maintaining a runningSum
    and then check runningSum %k == 0
    
    what about other nested subarrays that do not start from idx 0?
    if their remainder is not 0, we need to save their remainders
        - this means at some ith position we had some sum that left $r as remainder
    if we later run into the same remainder again, it means,
    that some other number was added to runningSum and this other number IS PERFECTLY DIVISIBLE BY K
    eg;
    k = 5
    23 + 1 = 24 ; 24 % 5 = 4
    23 + 1 + 7 = 31; 31 % 5 = 1
    23 + 1 + 7 + 2 = 33; 33 % 5 = 3
    23 + 1 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 35; 35 % 5 = 5
    ------ no same remainders yet ----------------
    23 + 1 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 39; 39%5 = 4 ( same remainder! )
         4               4
            sum after prev
            4 is exactly 
            divisible by k
            7+2+2+4 = 15
    23 +     15 ;
    15 % 5 = 0; and we are left with 23 % 5 = 4
    
    Therefore the only time we see the same remainder again is if
    we added some number to runningSum that was perfectly divisible by k
