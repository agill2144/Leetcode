    indegrees array to track number of incoming edge at a node,
    then whichever node has exactly n-1 value, thats the node with the most amount
    of incoming egdes 
    
    But instead of maintaining a outdegrees array to keep track of count number of edges going
    from this node, if this node does have a outgoing edge(s), then we will simply deduct its indeegree value 
    by 1 for each outgoing edge

    Then we will look for n-1 val in indegree, return idx if we find such value, 
    if we do not find a n-1 value, then that means there is no trusted person, return -1
    
    remember indegrees array counts the number of incoming edges to $this node ( i.e this translates to idx which is a node )
    
    in this case,
    we will track number of trusts given to a node 
    and we will reduce indegrees of person value
    then look for a node with exactly n-1 value
    and only return that node if this node does not have any outgoing edges
    in other words, this person does not trusts
